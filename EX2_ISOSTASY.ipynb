    "## Exercise 2: Isostasy and elasticity in orogenic plateaus\n",
    "\n",
    "The build-up of large orogenic plateaus, such as Tibet or the Central Andeas, is the result of the convergence between tectonic plates. Over time-scales of million years, crustal material is squeezed horizontally in the process of tectonic subduction, and therefore accumulates (i.e., builds up) vertically. Bellow (or in the exercise paper) you will find two figures that show the elevation and satellite-measured free-air gravity anomaly of the Tibetan Plateau area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select a point in the middle of the Tibetan Plateau where the free-air gravity anomaly is close to zero, but not exactly zero. Make a theoretical prediction of the thickness of its roots, assuming fully isostatic conditions (i.e., no elasticity), a crustal density of $2700$ $kg/m^3$, a mantle density of $3300$ $kg/m^3$, and a standard crust of thickness $35$ $km$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consider now the scenario where isostatic equilibrium is not achieved by a buoyant root (Airy compensation), but rather a mass deficit in the mountains and crust itself, i.e. the Tibet and the crust beneath are much lighter than regular crust. What would have to be the density in this case? Assume a full depth of compensation ($W = 35 km$). Is that density value reasonable, or even plausible for rocks? (for reference: $\\rho_{granite} = 2600$ $kg/m^3$, $\\rho_{shale} = 2500$ $kg/m^3$, $\\rho_{sediments} = 2000$ $kg/m^3$)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider now the possibility that the Tibetan Plateau is not isostatically compensated, but rather supported by the elastic strength of the lithosphere. What would have to be the elastic thickness of the lithosphere in this case? Estimate this for a support going North-South (its widest) and East-West (its narrowest). Is that value within the range of know lithospheric thicknesses? Even if it is not, what qualitative implication does this near-zero gravity anomaly have on the mantle?\n"
