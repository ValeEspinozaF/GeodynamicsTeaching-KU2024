    "The heat transported by the motion of mantle material is this exercise's topic. The first task is to estimate the heat flow ($q$) out of the Hawaiian plume. From tomographic images, you resolve the hot material to be flowing up a vertical pipe of radius $R = 50~km$. You also make out that the temperature difference between the hot material and the surrounding mantle is $\\Delta T = 100~^{\\circ}C$. Assume a vertical velocity up the pipe of $v = 1~m/yr$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume that flows past a point on a pipe within unit-time is $V = \\pi R^2 v$, where $v$ is the velocity of the flow. The amount of extra heat that has been carried past this points within unit-time is:\n",

    "$$ q = V \\cdot \\rho_P \\cdot C_p \\cdot \\Delta T $$\n",

    "### Part 2: More realistic approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In all honesty, using a perfectly cylindrical pipe is unrealistic - plus tomographic methods generally lack the resolution to resolve such thin features. Researchers have long developed alternative methods to estimate the heat flow out of plumes, in hopes to fully account for the Earth's heat budget. Namely, for the case of an upwelling plume, heat flow can be related to buoyancy flux ($Q_B$) by assuming that the excess buoyancy is generated by thermal expansion. According to Hoggard et al. (2020) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116317]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q = \\frac{C_P}{\\alpha} \\cdot Q_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha = 3 \\cdot 10^-5~C^-1$ is thermal expansivity, and $Q_B$ is buoyancy flux expressed in units of Mg/s (1 Mg = 10^3 kg). \n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep (1990) [https://doi.org/10.1029/JB095iB05p06715] described a method for constraining buoyancy flux for plumes located away from plate margins by measuring the rate at which new swell topography is generated and assuming that it is supported by thermal isostasy. If excess buoyancy is generated within the lithosphere, it moves downstream at the velocity of the overriding plate. The buoyancy flux ($Q_B$) can then be calculated by combining plate velocity ($v_p$) with the cross-sectional area of the swell above the conduit ($A$), measured perpendicular to the direction of plate motion. Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_B = (\\rho_P - \\rho_W) \\cdot A \\cdot v_p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho_P = 3300 kg~m^{-3}$ is the density of the mantle plume, $\\rho_W = 1000 kg~m^{-3}$ is the density of the water, $A$ is the cross-sectional swell area perpendicular to plate motion and $v_p$ is the plate velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the buoyancy flux and heat flow out of the Hawaiian plume. Use present-day geodetic plate motion models (namely REVEL, Sella et al., 2002) to estimate the plate velocity. The cross-sectional area of the swell can be estimated from the residual bathymetry of the Hawaiian swell, assuming a conical shape (see function `add_residual_tomography_hawaii` below).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How does this compare to the Part 1 estimation? You can also compare your buoyancy flux results against Sleep's estimate, by checking the file `BUOYANCY_FLUXES.txt`. Below in the notebook you will find the loading of this file as a pandas dataframe.  \n",

    "Now, based on the expression that relates heat flow ($q$) and buoyancy flux ($Q_B$), you are tasked with calculating the heat flow for all the plumes listed in the file `BUOYANCY_FLUXES.txt`. The code for this step is not written, and there are in fact many ways to tackle this. The most intuitive way might be some form of iteration. Take your time and try to come up with a code that does the job for all plumes. If you are feeling cheeky, you can try to have a *certain language model* do the code for you (you will need to be very descriptive of your problem, and likely do some fixes afterwards)."
