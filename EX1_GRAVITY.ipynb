    "Gravity is a powerful tool to study the Earth's interior. In this exercise, we will make use of some valuable information passed onto us by a Geophysicist. The Geophysicist has told us that beneath a hill, there is a body of high mineralogical value. The Geophysicist got as far as to measure the gravity anomaly along a profile from West to East. Measurements are stored in the DataFrame `grav_data` below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot the gravity anomaly and topography as a function of distance. Is there something odd about this profile? Based on what observation did the Geophysicist claim there to be a anomalous object?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make the necessary corrections to the gravity data. Make an short argument for all corrections, the ones you did and the ones you did not (Latitudinal, Free-Air, Bouguer). Plot the corrected gravity data as a function of distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determine whether the density of the alleged mineralized body is higher or lower than the surrounding rock.\n",
    "\n",
