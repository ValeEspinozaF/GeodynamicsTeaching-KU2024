    "## Exercise 9: Asthenospheric flow underneath a plate\n",
    "\n",
    "During the lectures on viscous flow dynamics, one of the exercises (Example 2) showed that the flow down a conduit is the result of gravity working against viscous resistance. In such a case the dynamic balance equation took the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu \\frac{\\delta^2 v_y}{\\delta x^2} + \\rho g = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the envelope of the resulting flow is a parabola (i.e., a second-degree polynomial function).\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of flow within a **horizontal** conduit, where a constant horizontal pressure gradient ($\\delta p/\\delta x$ = constant) is present, yields a similar equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu \\frac{\\delta^2 v_x}{\\delta y^2} - \\frac{\\delta p}{\\delta x}  = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the resulting flow envelope is also a polynomial of second-degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "With reference to Figure 1 (in the exercise paper), imagine a tectonic plate (in orange) of length $L$ that moves at a velocity $v_p$ on top of a Newtonian asthenosphere (in green) of viscosity $\\mu_a$ and thickness $H_a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain an expression for the velocity of asthenospheric horizontal flow underneath the plate ($v_x(y)$) by solving the flow equation (equation 2). **HELP**: under the specific conditions of this exercise, eq. 2 is a relatively simple differential equation. In order to solve it, notice you have the second derivative equal to a term deemed as constant ($\\frac{\\delta p}{\\delta x}$). Think then what are the velocity conditions at the top ($y = H_a$) and bottom ($y = 0$) boundaries of the asthenosphere (i.e., the boundary conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Imagine also that the horizontal pressure difference within the asthenosphere ($\\delta p$) across the plate length is equal to the pressure generated by a 1-km thick block of crust (density $\\rho$ is 2700 kg/m3). The gradient of pressure along the x-axis can therefore be expressed as:\n",
    "$$-\\rho_c g h / L$$ \n",
    "where $\\rho_c$ is the density of the crust and $h$ is the thickness of the block of crust.\n",
    "Plot a graph of the flow velocity against asthenospheric depth using parameter values (i.e., L, $\\mu_a$, etc.) of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plot the flow velocity against asthenospheric depth for the *Couette* part of the flow, i.e. the flow that is solely induced by plate motion (and not pressure gradients). **HELP**: solve the second derivative equation for the case where $\\delta p = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find the expression for the *Poiseuille* part of the flow, i.e. the flow that is solely induced by the pressure gradient. **HELP**: Isolate the *Couette* part expression from the general solution obtained in (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Obtain an expression for the generic horizontal shear stress within the asthenosphere. **HELP**: recall that the shear stress for a 2D scenario is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau = 2\\mu \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\delta v_x}{\\delta y} + \\frac{\\delta v_y}{\\delta x} \\right)$$"
